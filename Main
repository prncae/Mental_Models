#Mental Models of My Life

The Goal of this site is dedicated to creating a single repository which can access all major mental models I use to find patterns in the world.
As we know from Chaos Theory, while things may seem like chaos, there really is a beauty and pattern behind most phenomina in the world.  In that same mindset, we know that everything is connected in some way, and that by learning some models we can project those laws which are indestructible, over many different disciplines
